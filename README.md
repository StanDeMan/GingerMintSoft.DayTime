# DayTime 
A first draft for a pv plant - identifying sun rise and sun set times to store power to a battery and to use the energy over night.
The sun rise and sun set code was taken from here: https://github.com/aureldussauge/SunriseSunset - slightly reworked (original is a C port)
Install this library: https://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/pigpiod.html to get this up and running. Pigpiod has an issues with RPi 5 - not running so far, sadly
